In this Task 3, we had to make a form which takes input from the user and displays the data on the same page. I made a form in HTML, passed the data through calling a javascript function whenever the submit button is clicked and displaying the entered data in a tabular format by making a new row in the center of the division each time when javascript is called through the submit button. Got CSS properties for all division and table rows.

## Have a look at updated version of this [here](https://huzefamehidpurwala.github.io/Data-Entry-Form/).
